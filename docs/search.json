    "text": "Core Values\n\nDiversity and inclusion: Language research is a diverse field that intersects with numerous branches of qualitative and quantitative science. We encourage scientists from all fields to participate in ManyLanguages and support diversity in the the types of projects, languages, participants, and researchers in our community.\nTransparency: We engage in transparency on all policies, procedures, and projects. Each project will include a pre-registered plan including appropriate hypothesis, methods, and analysis for that specific research area. All policies are posted on our website for at-large review.\nOpenness: We believe that the languages sciences can only benefit from open sharing of research. When appropriate, data, code, materials, preprints, etc. will be shared in an open and reusable format. We strive to make these research outputs FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable) by posting to open source platforms and organizing information. Given ethical concerns, we will strive to create synthetic or otherwise suitably anonymous research outputs.\nResponsiveness: We expect a diversity of ideas and backgrounds within the ManyLanguages community. We will be responsive to criticism, challenges of beliefs, and other feedback within the guidelines of our code of conduct. Policies and procedures will be updated based on discussion and feedback from members."

    "text": "Code of conduct for ManyLanguages\nVersion 1.1\nThis is the current state of the code of conduct. We consider this document a living document. Please be aware that it is subject to changes as our government structure, our tools as well as our channels of communication evolve.\nManyLanguages is dedicated to providing a welcoming and supportive environment for all people, regardless of background or identity. As such, we do not tolerate behaviour that is disrespectful or that excludes or intimidates others. We do not tolerate discrimination or harassment based on characteristics that include, but are not limited to, sex, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, citizenship, nationality, ethnic or social origin, pregnancy, familial status, veteran status, genetic information, religion or belief (or lack thereof), membership of a national minority, property, age, education, socio-economic status, technical choices, and experience level. \n\n\nReport an Incident\nPlease use the following form to report an incident of a code of conduct violation. You may choose to remain anonymous or give your information.\nLINK TO A FORM HERE\n\n\nExpected Behaviour\nAll individuals involved in our membership, projects, and communications are expected to show respect and courtesy to others. All interactions should be professional regardless of platform (i.e., either online or in-person). \nTo foster a positive and professional environment we encourage the following kinds of behaviours in all ManyLanguages events and communications:\n\nUse welcoming and inclusive language \nBe respectful of different viewpoints and experiences \nGracefully accept constructive criticism \nFocus on what is best for the community \nShow courtesy and respect towards other community members \n\n\n\nUnacceptable Behaviour\nExamples of unacceptable behaviour by participants at any ManyLanguages event/platform include (a non-exhaustive list): \n\nWritten or verbal comments which have the effect of excluding people on the basis of membership of any specific group \nCausing someone to fear for their safety, such as through stalking, following, or intimidation \nViolent threats or language directed against another person \nThe display of sexual or violent images \nUnwelcome sexual attention \nNon-consensual or unwelcome physical contact \nSustained disruption of talks, events or communications \nInsults or put downs \nSexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist, or exclusionary jokes \nExcessive swearing \nIncitement to violence, suicide, or self-harm \nContinuing to initiate interaction (including photography or recording) with someone after being asked to stop \nPublication of private communication without consent \n\n\n\nConsequences of Unacceptable Behaviour\nParticipants who are asked to stop any inappropriate behaviour are expected to comply immediately. This applies to all ManyLanguages events and platforms, either online or in-person. If a participant engages in behaviour that violates this Code of Conduct, the Leadership Team may warn the offender, ask them to leave the event or platform (without refund, if applicable), or engage the Leadership Team to investigate the Code of Conduct violation and impose appropriate sanctions if necessary. \n\n\nIncident Reporting Guidelines\n\nContact points\nIf someone violates the Code of Conduct during a ManyLanguages related event or communication, we ask that you report it to the event host, organiser, or a designated incident response person. The person you have talked to should make a report to ManyLanguages about the incident by contacting the Leadership Team. If this is not possible for some reason, we would be very grateful if you could report the incident yourself. \nIf a violation occurs in an online space outside of organised events, please contact us by completing a report without disclosing your identity via our contact.\n\n\nWhat to do if someone is in physical danger\nIf you believe someone is in physical danger, please ask a staff member or volunteer to contact appropriate emergency services. All event organisers should, before the event, determine who it would be appropriate to contact in case of an incident. Once the incident has been resolved, we ask that it be reported to the Leadership Team in the same way as all other incidents. \n\n\nCode of Conduct Enforcement\nA detailed enforcement policy is available in the Enforcement Manual below. \n\n\nEnforcement Manual\nThis section includes the enforcement manual followed by the Leadership Team. It is used when we respond to an issue to make sure we are consistent and fair. It should be considered an internal document, but we are publishing it publicly in the interests of transparency. Enforcement of the Code of Conduct should be respectful and not include any harassing behaviours. \n\n\nThe Leadership Team\nAll responses to reports of conduct violations will be managed by the Leadership Team. The Leadership Team may jointly establish a Review Group, made up of independent representatives. One member will be designated chair of the Review Group and will be responsible for all reports back to the Leadership Team. \n\n\nHow the Leadership Team will respond to reports\nWhen a report is sent to the Leadership Team, they will immediately reply to the report to confirm receipt as soon as possible, unless the report is anonymous. This reply should/must be sent within 2 days. If a report does not contain enough information, the Leadership Team will attempt to obtain all relevant data before acting. The Leadership Team is empowered to act on behalf of ManyLanguages in contacting any individuals involved to get a more complete account of events. The Leadership Team is also empowered to act if any of its members become aware of ongoing behaviours that, when taken individually, do not meet a threshold for reporting, nonetheless when considered in aggregate are disrupting or harassing or unacceptable in other ways. \n\n\nUrgent Situations: Acting Unilaterally\nIf the incident involves physical danger, or involves a threat to anyone’s safety (e.g., threats of violence), any member of the Leadership Team and/or the event host, organiser, or a designated incident response person (“the respondent”) may – and should – act unilaterally to protect safety. This action can include contacting law enforcement (or other local personnel) and speaking on behalf of ManyLanguages. \nIf the act is ongoing, the respondent may act immediately, before reaching consensus, to diffuse the situation. In ongoing situations, the respondent may at their discretion employ any of the tools available to the Leadership Team, including bans and blocks. In situations where the respondent acts unilaterally, they must inform the Leadership Team members as soon as possible, and report their actions to the Review Group for review within 24 hours.\n\n\nLess-Urgent Situations\nUpon receiving a report of an incident, the Leadership Team will inform the Review Group, who will review the incident and determine, to the best of their ability: \n\nwhether this is an ongoing situation; \nwhether there is a threat to anyone’s physical safety; \nwhat happened; \nwhich part of the Code of Conduct (if any) was violated; \nwho (if anyone) violated the Code of Conduct. \n\nThis information will be collected in writing, and whenever possible the Review Group’s deliberations will be recorded and retained (i.e. email discussions, recorded voice conversations, etc.). \nThese records will be made available to the Leadership Team and ManyLanguages members, suitably redacted if necessary (e.g., to retain anonymity). \nThe Review Group should aim to have a resolution agreed upon within one week. In the event that a resolution cannot be determined at that time, the Review Group will respond to the reporter(s) with an update and projected timeline for resolution. \n\n\nResolutions\nThe Review Group must agree on a resolution by consensus of all members investigating the report in question. If the Review Group cannot reach consensus and deadlocks for over a week, they will turn the matter over to the Leadership Team for resolution. \nPossible responses may include: \n\nTaking no further action (if the Review Group determines no violation occurred). \nA private reprimand from the Review Group to the individual(s) involved. In this case, the Review Group chair will deliver that reprimand to the individual(s) over email, cc’ing the Review Group. \nA public announcement of an incident, ideally in the same venue that the violation occurred (i.e., on the listserv for a listserv violation, GitHub for a GitHub violation, etc.). The Review Group may choose to publish this message elsewhere to create a permanent public record. \nAn imposed suspension (i.e., asking someone to “take a week off” from a listserv or the ManyLanguages GitHub or OSF repositories or membership portal platform). The Review Group chair will communicate this suspension to the individual(s). They’ll be asked to take this suspension voluntarily, but if they do not agree then a temporary ban may be imposed to enforce this vacation. \nA permanent or temporary ban from some or all ManyLanguages spaces (listservs, GitHub, OSF groups, membership portal, in-person events including workshops, etc.). The Leadership Team will maintain records of all such bans so that they may be reviewed in the future, extended to new ManyLanguages communication forums, or otherwise maintained. \nAssistance to the complainant with a report to other bodies, for example, institutional offices or appropriate law enforcement agencies. \n\nOnce a resolution is agreed upon, but before it is enacted, the Review Group will contact the original reporter and any other affected parties and explain the proposed resolution. The Review Group will ask if this resolution is acceptable and note feedback for the record. However, the Review Group is not required to act on this feedback. \nFinally, the Review Group will make a report to the Leadership Team in the event of an ongoing resolution, such as a ban. \nThe Review Group will never publicly discuss the details of the issue; all public statements will be made by the Leadership Team. \n\n\nConflicts of Interest\nIn the event of any conflict of interest (a Leadership member, their family member, or someone with whom the Leadership member has a close academic, personal or employment relationship is involved in a complaint), the Leadership member must immediately notify the other members, and recuse themselves if necessary. \n\n\nMaintaining Confidentiality\nThe Leadership members will take care to maintain the confidentiality of information they receive as members of the Code of Conduct enforcement team. This includes names and contact information of the reporters and the reportees (i.e., the people about whom a report has been made). \nInformation will be held on file so that repeated violations and small violations over a long period may be recorded, and used to inform appropriate action. This information will be stored securely for 10 years, and accessible only to those with a strict need to know. It will not be used for any other purpose or shared with anyone else. Future members of the Review Group may have access to this information. In some instances, information may be shared with the Leadership Team. \nAll Leadership Members commit to treating all members of the ManyLanguages community fairly and with respect at all times. Information they have access to as a result of being a member of the code of conduct enforcement team will not be used for making decisions outside of this role."

    "text": "Membership\nAll individuals are invited for membership in ManyLanguages. To be considered a member you must:\n\nFollow the Code of Conduct.\nActively engage in the membership portal. This process includes:\n\nLogging into the membership portal once the invitation has been received.\nMaintaining an active email as your login for the portal. Accounts with emails that bounce will be removed.\nFill out the membership survey to assist in the formation of ad hoc committees. This survey will be used to help diversify those who are solicited to help with tasks.\n\nYou are not required to participate in any specific projects or leadership roles to be considered a member. Membership can be as simple as the desire to keep up with the community - however, this requires you log into the portal to receive updates.\n\n\n\nLeadership\n\nNumber of members: The leadership team will consist of no less than five but no more than nine formal members.\nChair: One person will be appointed the chair of the leadership team. The chair will organize meetings, keep meeting notes, and relay information to the necessary personnel on project teams or committees. The chair position will be selected by the current leadership team every two years.\nPosition length: Leadership members’ terms are four years in length, with the possibility of renewal, given the current leadership and community approval. Leadership members may also resign their post at any time.\nSelection: These members will be selected by the current leadership team and input from the overall community. A call for new members will be broadcast to the network, and members can apply for open positions. These applications will be presented to the network for general ranking based on personal statements. Once network input has been received, each applicant will be reviewed by the current leadership committee (including the outgoing member), and individual(s) will be selected to fulfill the role with an eye toward research, geographic, and other forms of diversity.\nRole: The leadership team will meet at least monthly to discuss current goals, issues, projects, or other topics as needed as set by the current chair. They are responsible for the day-to-day organization and maintenance of the network including updates to policies, convening ad hoc committees, troubleshooting issues brought by members, membership portal maintenance, and more.\n\nThe current leadership team consists of: TBA.\n\n\nCommittees\n\nProject Monitoring\nThe project monitoring (PM) committee will be comprised of at least one person from each of the ManyLanguage projects. This person can be designated by the project lead team or appointed by the leadership team. The PM committee will meet monthly to discuss project status, timelines, goals, issues, and other discussions necessary to ensure timely and appropriately completed projects. The PM is generally responsible for relaying the project’s progress and for adhering to policies for ManyLanguages projects. Other PM tasks may include:\n\nAll lead team duties should be defined at the beginning of the project with coordination by the PM (i.e., who will answer emails? who is in charge of data? etc.). These duties may change throughout the project but a clear definition will help PM and lead team members with role ambiguity.\nCoordinating and attending meetings for the project they are working with.\nTaking meeting notes, coordinating who will complete required tasks, and following up on those tasks.\nOrganizing and maintaining CRediT information.\n\n\n\nAd Hoc Committees\nAd hoc committees will be formed when a specific directive or need arises within the community. Ad hoc committees be filled by first polling the membership for interest in joining the committee. If this process does not fill the number of persons necessary for that committee, the leadership team will reach out to individuals based on the membership survey to help find members for the roles. Specific ad hoc committees we expect include:\n\nCode of conduct violation review: This committee will be tasked with reviewing code of conduct violations and following guidelines presented in that policy.\nStudy selection: This committee will organize the call for studies, coordinate the receipt of submissions for studies, solicit and coordinate the review of studies, send out the studies for network voting, and organize the information provided by the reviewers and network. The study selection committee will provide recommendations on the studies to the leadership team for selection.\nPre-study review: A study review team will be created before the study is launched to review all materials, policies, and other necessities are in place before the network is notified of the study. They will ensure adherence to policies for studies (for example, posted preprint, preregistered plans, collaboration agreement, etc.). The pre-study review team will provide feedback and assistance in the potential ethics process.\nPost-study review: When a study is completed (i.e., a manuscript will be sent for publication), a post-study review team will be created. This team will coordinate the posting of FAIR materials, data, and other outputs into the ManyLanguages format on our GitHub page. A team member will provide code/analysis-check to ensure reproducibility when appropriate. Given that individual studies may result in multiple manuscripts, this process will be repeated for each manuscript."

    "text": "Call for Studies\nWe will advertise calls for studies on a yearly basis. The call for studies will be sent to the network for submissions, as coordinated by the study selection team. A form will be posted when the call for studies is open, but the generally the submission guidelines will include a 10-15 page proposal structured as a small preregistration plan/manuscript. Projects that are small in scope (i.e., only a small number of network members will be recruited or interested) may be reviewed on a quarterly basis.\n\n\nStudy Selection\nStudy selection will be based on a few factors:\n\nScale of the project: We expect projects to vary in desired size and scale. We will do our best to examine the feasibility of having several large-scale and several smaller-scale studies.\nDiversity of topic: Projects will vary in topic to promote diversity in linguistics. Therefore, we may decline a study for being too close in topic to another recently started project. We will also investigate avenues to combine related projects (if feasible).\nFeasibility: Given our network capabilities, we will determine the feasibility of specific studies, and we may decline studies that are deemed unfeasible with discussion of the study selection team.\nProposal quality: Proposals will be assessed for quality, in the preparation of the proposal, and clarity of the methods. We will receive feedback about methodological and theoretical rigor (i.e., it appears the study is sound versus disagreements in literature/interpretation).\n\nStudies will be given an 1) acceptance, 2) accept with minor revisions, 3) revise and resubmit, 4) decline with encouragement to revision and resubmit in the next round. While we likely cannot run every project, but we believe that all submitters should receive feedback and encouragement to complete their project. We reserve the right to reject studies that are inappropriate in content.\n\n\nStudy Requirements\n\nLeadership Team\nThe leadership team will consist of proposing authors, a designated project monitor, and others who have the necessary skill sets for the project requirements. For example, a team may include a translation coordinator, ethics coordinator, or other specialized skill sets (see below). This team will be responsible for the project, communicating with the team members and leadership team, manuscript production and submission, and coordinating with relevant committees. The leadership team should meet at least monthly (and likely more) to ensure adequate progress towards completion.\n\n\nGood Faith Effort\nThe leadership team will ensure a good faith effort to complete the project as intended. Network members will likely donate their time and resources, and we want to provide them with the incentives promised (i.e., usually authorship). If the leadership team no longer wishes to complete the project, they will appoint personnel to take over the project and update the collaboration agreement. If the team wishes to stop the project before network members have been recruited, the team may withdraw from the study selection process.\n\n\nCollaboration Agreements\nAll projects will have a collaboration agreement as outline in our authorship policies.\n\n\nOpen Science Principles\n\nPreregistration: All studies will include a preregistered plan of methods, potential analyses, and other facets determined before the start of the study. Language science is a broad field, and these plans will look different for each proposed project.\nPreprint: A preprint of the main manuscript with preregistered plans will be posted before the study starts. We also suggest registered report formats and submissions, but they\nDeviation Guide: All studies will include a guide that indicates deviations from the preregistered plan. This information can be hard to track, and we suggest maintaining this guide by taking notes in regular meetings.\nCRediT: All studies will provide CRediT taxonomy related information.\nFAIR Outputs: All studies will provide all sharable outputs from the study. This information includes ethics review documents, materials, translations, data, code, analyses, manuscripts, and more. All outputs will include metadata and information on who created each output.\n\n\n\n\nStudy Support\n\nWe recommend forming a study leadership team that is based on the skills required to adequately complete the project. The leadership team and study review committees will assist in filling those roles if no one from the leadership team includes those skill sets. We recommend including members from the community (i.e., not all from one institution) to diversify idea viewpoint and networks.\nA pre- and post-study completion review team will engage with the leadership team of the study. The roles of this team are outline on the people policies page. They will ensure adherence to ManyLanguages policies and assist in sharing of materials, coordination of outputs, etc.\nWe will provide template and guidelines on how to engage and successfully complete a large-scale project."

    "text": "Collaboration Agreements\nAll studies will include a collaboration agreement with the following sections (non-exhaustive):\n\nAnticipated products: a list of potential manuscripts, outputs, or other expected outcomes.\nRoles and responsibilities: an outline of what the expected contributions may include, who may be responsible for them, and how they are credited.\nAuthorship guidelines: Include minimum requirements for authorship based on credit information, information on the proposed order of authors, information on authorship for secondary outputs (i.e., if a new manuscript idea is formed during the project, how will / can individuals become involved?)\nDissenting opinions: a statement on how dissenting opinions on findings, disagreements, and conflict management.\nConduct: refer to the code of conduct and any specific policies based on the study. Include relevant journal policies.\nChanges: an explicit section for updates and changes to the policy.\n\n\n\nCRediT\nWe will use CRediT guidelines to establish roles and denote the contributions for each member of a project. Each author must usually complete at least two CRediT categories for inclusion on a manuscript for publication. Journal policies often require that all authors must include Writing - Review & Editing. The definitions for CRediT are purposely vague in order to be flexible. However, we provide a table below that gives a general idea of how each project may define contributions for projects (taken from here and edited).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContributor Role\nRole Definition\n\n\n\n\nConceptualization\nLeading, documenting, and summarizing discussions that lead to formulation or evolution of overarching research goals and aims.\n\n\nData Curation\nManagement activities to merge and maintain research data (including software code, where it is necessary for interpreting the data itself) in an online repository for initial use and later reuse.\n\n\nFormal Analysis\nApplication of formal analysis techniques to analyse or synthesize study data, provided these analyses are included in the paper or supplementary materials.\n\n\nFunding Acquisition\nAcquisition of the financial support for the project leading to this publication.\n\n\nInvestigation\nConducting a research and investigation process. This process may include data collection from individuals, collecting language samples from other resources, or other applications depending on the study.\n\n\nMethodology\nDevelopment or design of methodology; creation of models. Writing/designing the pre-registration.\n\n\nProject Administration\nManagement and coordination responsibility for the research activity planning and execution. Preparing and disseminating protocols and coding instructions. Ensuring that deadlines are met.\n\n\nResources\nDeveloping or providing critical instrumentation or equipment to institutions other than one’s own. Providing translation or other services for materials, stimuli, etc.\n\n\nSoftware\nProgramming, software development; designing computer programs; implementation of the computer code and supporting algorithms; testing of existing code components.\n\n\nValidation\nVerification of the overall replication/reproducibility of results/experiments and other research outputs.\n\n\nVisualization\nPreparation, creation and/or presentation of the published work, specifically visualization/data presentation, provided these visualizations are included in the paper or supplementary materials.\n\n\nWriting\nPreparation and creation of the published work by those from the original research group, specifically critical review, commentary or revision – including pre- or post-publication stages.\n\n\n\n\n\nConsortium Authorship\nWhen possible, we believe that each person should be listed explicitly on the manuscript due to tenure, promotion, and cultural policies that disincentivize consortium publications. If lead team authors wish to publish in a journal that has restrictive author policies, the collaboration team should be notified of this policy as soon as possible, so they may decide on their desired level of contribution."
