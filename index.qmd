## Vision Statement

ManyLanguages is a globally distributed network of language science laboratories that coordinates data collection for democratically selected studies.

Our mission is to facilitate the connection between language science researchers to diversify the languages, participants, researchers, and projects represented in the language sciences. We will facilitate the collection of evidence across the language sciences by supporting a distributed laboratory network that is ongoing, diverse, and inclusive. We embrace open science principles by sharing collected data, materials, translations, and other research outputs from the network. We strive to engage research across a broad spectrum of language sciences creating an inclusive and diverse environment for ideas, investigation, and participation.
